 Once you visit the site you will land to login page their are inputs for email and password but as of you we can directly reach to dashboard by clicking on Login ot Register.

 <br>
 Their will be dashboard where we can select the categories by clicking on that tab. If we don't find any tab related to our query then we can click on the   Interact With Eila  and on hover we can listen the voice "Ella is an 
interactive chatbot", If we click on that we can see a new interface where we can interact. 

 <br>
 If we type a query and click on send then a video start playing. but as of now that video is not the solution of that query but it is for demonstration purpose. also we can record our voice ans the recorded transcript will be shown their. and after that if we chick that send button our recorded transcript will be send and again video start playing.


<br>
I tried to extract transcript of the video but unfortunately not able to do that i think i need to research more on that.
